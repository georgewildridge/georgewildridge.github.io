bio: |
  Bio. I am currently a senior at Choate Rosemary Hall with a passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have spent my past three summers interning in Yale's Social Robotics Lab under the direction of Dr. Bradley Hayes, Dr. Alessandro Roncone and Dr. Olivier Manguin. During my first summer at Yale, I taught myself five new programming languages and created a demo that involved teaching a robot to read as well as to identify and track objects. The summer of 2015, again under the direction of Dr. Bradley Hayes, I implemented five project geared toward learning about deep learning and neural networks. As a final project, I implemented a convolutional neural network on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. Last summer, under the direction of Dr. Alessandro Roncone and Dr. Olivier Mangin I assisted directly on research. Our work focused on enabling efficient human robot collaboration. My job was to give the robot the ability to understand its surroundings and the task at hand through the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  


  At Choate, I entered the competitive Science Research Program(SRP) at the beginning of my junior year. SRP is an academic program offered to prepare students for professional science research, by giving students the oppourtunity to hone the skills of an active researcher: thinking and writing scientifically, developing presentation skills, quantitative analysis and reading primary scientific literature. My junior year of SRP provided time for me to build a solid conceptual foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning through independent research that concluded in both a review paper I wrote last spring and my research at Yale again last summer. This past fall, I tied together my research at Yale with a final paper and poster, as well as a presentation that was given to the Choate faculty and student body.  In addition to SRP, at Choate I also worked with the head of the math department to create two directed studies: I worked through Stanford’s course "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" to gain a concrete understanding of machine learning techniques, and another designed around Yale’s course "Mathematical Concepts Oriented Toward Computer Science” with the intention of better understanding advanced concepts in mathematics related to computer science that had proven challenging in my research.
