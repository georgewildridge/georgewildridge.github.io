#Bio

I am currently a senior at Choate Rosemary Hall with a passion for computer science and, more specifically, machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have spent my past three summers interning in Yale's Social Robotics Lab under the direction of Dr. Bradley Hayes, Dr. Alessandro Roncone and Dr. Olivier Manguin. At Choate, I entered the competitive Science Research Program(SRP) at the beginning of my junior year, a academic program offered by Choate to prepare students for professional science research. Despite participating in research for the previous two years, SRP gave me the opportunity to hone the skills of an active researcher: thinking and writing scientifically, developing presentation skills, quantitative analysis and reading primary scientific literature. It also provided ample time for me to build a solid conceptual foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning through independent research that concluded in review paper I wrote last spring and research at Yale again last summer. At Choate, with the help of the head of the math department, Dr. Bardoe, and my computer science teacher, Ms. Hoke, I also put together a directed study last spring with the intention of being further prepared for research that I modeled off Stanford's course "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" in which I worked through the lectures and assignments independently. At the moment I am currently participating in my final term of SRP in which I sum up my summer with a presentation, paper and poster. In addition, I also put together another directed study for this term with the intention of better understanding advanced concepts in mathematics related to computer science that has proven challenging in my research. I modeled this course off of Yale's course "Mathematical Concepts Oriented Toward Computer Science". This spring I am excited to adventure outside of my comfort zone in machine learning and try my hand at Choate's course on application development. I also have a leading role in both Choate's Robotics Club and Choate's Programming Club. Last year I lead one of Choate's four robotics teams in the Vex Robotics Competition to New Englands and played a leading role in bringing one of our robots to Vex Worlds in Louisville, Kentucky last April. Within the programming club, I lead one of four groups in which I teach my fellow students about the more advanced aspects of computer science including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and lead students on small projects that I put together based off of my time working at Yale. Finally, I have made the effort to keep a running academic blog in which I document the work that I have completed so as to be a resource to myself and others, thus, nearly everything I have mentioned above has some spot on this website. Feel free to explore!

Oddly enough, my passion for computer science aside, I am also quite interested in the humanities, in which I pushed myself to take one of the hardest courses my school has to offer alongside of SRP last year: American Studies. This course was an intensive combination of Honors English and AP US History in which a serious effort is made to understand both the origins of America and America's ideologies. This was one of the best courses I have ever taken as I found myself constantly surprised by America's distinct influence on my identity through growing up here. This lead to a constant reassessing of how I see myself as it forced me to question values deeply rooted within me that I often never realized I felt so strongly about. As I discovered more about myself, I have also gained more insight on where I stand politically which manifested itself in me joining Choate's Young Centrist club last fall, of which I am now the Vice President. This club has proven to be a very beneficial space for me to challenge my political opinions as I have found the term centrist beckons people of all belief systems that don't perfectly align with the predominant parties. 

Beyond academics I enjoy rowing and playing water polo and really anything that gets me outside and moving. For the past six years, I have woken up at 4:45 to go skull a half hour from my house at the New Haven Rowing Club three to five times a week. I am also a member of Choateâ€™s rowing team which I participate in in the spring. Through sculling, I participated in the junior singles at the Head of the Housatonic last fall as I intended to do this fall again alongside the Head of the Charles; however, I broke my arm falling off my skateboard early on in the summer which took me out of a boat for almost two months and threw off my training regimen. When I returned, it became evident that I had little chance of being competitive in the aforementioned regattas, especially on top of my course work senior fall. Instead I decided to return to Choate's Water Polo team which I have participated in for the past two years and will begin training again over the Winter and Spring. I also had the opportunity to volunteer to help maintain a local community garden this summer which provided a needed reprieve from my computer screen. Finally, I have also played an active role in assisting at the New Haven branch of IRIS, helping to stock the shelves in their food pantry and assisting in delivering the food to New Haven's Refugees.
